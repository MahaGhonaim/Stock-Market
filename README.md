## 01. Data Collection
The data used in this project was sourced from various reputable platforms, including **Yahoo Finance**, **Wikipedia**, **Kaggle**, and additional **EXCEL** files provided. 
Each source provided different types of data that were crucial for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the American stock market.

* **Yahoo Finance**: We get the data from yahoo finance by using a python code

* **Wikipedia**: ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)
  
   Data regarding company-specific information, such as sector classifications and business descriptions, was gathered from Wikipedia. This allowed for an analysis 
                of stock performance at the sector level, providing insights into how different industries perform in the market.

* **Kaggle**:(https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500)
  
   Kaggle datasets were used to obtain additional financial and operational data, such as revenue, profit, and other key metrics. Kaggle hosts a wide range of publicly 
             available datasets, which are useful for in-depth financial and business analysis.

* **Custom Excel Files**: Additional EXCEL files were used to complement the data from the mentioned sources.

  These files contained preprocessed data specifically tailored for the projectâ€™s needs, including date dimension tables, GIO Fact, SP500 historical data, and financial fact data.

### 03. Data Cleaning

Performed in **Excel**:
  Data cleaning is an essential step to ensure that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Excel was used to clean and prepare the American stock market 
  data. The cleaning process included removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring uniform formatting across the dataset.

**Cleaning Steps**
1. Checking and Correcting Data Types
2. Null Checks (Handling Missing Values)
3. Outliers Detection and Treatment
4. Splitting Columns by Comma (Date Formatting)
5. Ensuring Data Accuracy

## 03. Database Design

**PostgreSQL** was used as the primary tool for executing analytical SQL queries on the datasets. Analytical SQL played a critical role in extracting meaningful insights from the stock market data, enabling deep exploration of stock price movements, trading volumes, sector-based performance, and financial metrics.

**Tables:**

* `fact_stock`: Stock trading data (open, close, volume, etc.)
* `security`: Company metadata (sector, location, founding year)
* `fact_financial`: Financial performance (EPS, dividends, market cap)
* `sp500_historical_data`: Daily index metrics
* `gio_fact`: Economic indicators (gold, oil, interest rates)
* `date_dim`: Date dimension table for time-based analysis
